## Contributing

Titanium is an open source project. Titanium wouldn't be where it is now without
contributions by the community. Please consider forking this repo to improve,
enhance or fix issues. If you feel like the community will benefit from your
fork, please open a pull request.

To protect the interests of the Titanium contributors, Appcelerator, customers
and end users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement
(CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is simple and
straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any
Appcelerator open source project are properly licensed and that you have the
legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future
legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes only a few
minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

[You can digitally sign the CLA](http://bit.ly/app_cla) online. Please indicate
your e-mail address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that
will locate your CLA. Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one
for subsequent submissions.
